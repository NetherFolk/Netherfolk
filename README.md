## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on a `hangman clone` made in C using the C standard library!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, Raylib, and Makefiles.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing for now!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking help finding the logic in a hangman game!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me how it feels to be bad at coding I guess?
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm `nopeist_9239` on Discord!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.
> âš¡ Fun fact: 'Re: Zero - Starting Life in Another World' is my favourite story right now!

Sincerely,
